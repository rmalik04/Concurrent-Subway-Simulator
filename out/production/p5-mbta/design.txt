For this project, I made a thread for each train and also a thread for each passenger. This allowed the trains and passengers to move independently of each other. For locks, I used locks on each station. This would ensure that the trains could move from station to station without crashing into other trains. Additionally, passengers can acquire the station lock while the train is at the station so they they can board and deboard the train.
